# Vocab_Tester

This is a program I made to test vocabulary to help me learn Spanish. Choose from a variety of vocab lists, or create your own through the program. 

After being compiled as a package with "javac textfiles/VocabTester.java" this program will need to be run with command "java textfiles.VocabTester". The vocabulary is read from lists put into a folder in the same folder as the class files named "Vocab".

Type "exit" to quit the program  and "menu" to return to the main menu at any point.
